## PIQuery

#### Description
This application provides a very simple framework to query Cisco Prime Infrastructure for information.   It can be expanded to provide different types of queries to return different information.

#### Requirements
This module is currently written in Python 2.x.

#### Example
The current version of the PIQuery will query for the user client tracking information.   Therefore, it will list all devices attached to parent switches.

```
